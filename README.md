### Hi there, hooman! :robot:

My name is Lais and I am a Developer Advocate, DevRel for the intimates :avocado: My background is in Civil and Env. Eng. and I love Python and data visualisations. :smile:
> NOTE: Curious about the avocado joke? Check out the explanation by [Mary Thengvall](https://www.marythengvall.com/blog/2018/1/31/developer-avocados-the-good-kind-of-fat).

#### What I do üì´

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on [QHub](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/) an open source library that helps data scientists deploy their projects to the Cloud straight from JupyterHub with a GitOps approach. In summary, a *DevOps-for-Notebooks* tool. For more details, check out the release at [JupyterCon](https://www.quansight.com/post/announcing-qhub).

#### Community üßú‚Äç
- :shamrock: I am a board member of [Python Ireland](https://python.ie/) since Oct/19, where I hosted [a few meetups](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNeBS51Q0m98sqBDz8_HyAFqp8YW78-g8) and helped with PyCon.
- üß∂ Co-organiser of [Pyjamas Conference](twitter.com/pyjamasconf), a 24 hours world-wide Python conference where everyone is invited to wear pajamas.
- üìö Volunteer for [EuroPython](https://twitter.com/europythons) since Feb/20.

#### Fun facts ‚ö°
- üëæ I used to work (and have a serious crush) on [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/), a DS/ML Python framework that uses software engineering best pratcies to help teams work more efficiently, the Django of ML/DS projects.
